# Problem-Solving-with-Baekjoon
The solutions of the selected problems in Baekjoon Online Judge will be recorded here.
The name of code was determined in the following form, "#(number of the problem)_(title of the problem)" or "(title of the problem set)_#(number)#(number2) 
and the code would be mainly written in Python 3.
If you need additional explanation of the code, please visit the following blog. https://kanghyeonkim.tistory.com/
In addition, if there is any issue on the code, let me know through the visitor's book of the above blog.

In the first step(problems in "Basic" folder in here), I will follow the order of the problems in https://plzrun.tistory.com/entry/%EC%95%8C%EA%B3%A0%EB%A6%AC%EC%A6%98-%EB%AC%B8%EC%A0%9C%ED%92%80%EC%9D%B4PS-%EC%8B%9C%EC%9E%91%ED%95%98%EA%B8%B0.
